 * running this command: " $ npm run supa-ts "
 *
 *
 * OBS: dont forget to update project-ref in the script "supa-ts" inside
 * package.json. read text below to understand where it comes from.
 *
 * You can find your project-ref in the URL of your Supabase project dashboard.
 * It is the string of random characters that comes after https://app.supabase.io/project/.

 * For example, if the URL of your Supabase project dashboard is
 * https://app.supabase.io/project/abcdefg12345, then abcdefg12345 is your project-ref.
